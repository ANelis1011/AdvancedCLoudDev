## Collaboration and Contribution
- Pull Requests: You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers. If you have improvements or additions to the classworks, create a pull request to the main repository.

```
git checkout -b <feature-branch>
git commit -m "Add your message here"
git push origin <feature-branch>
```
- Merging: Pull requests will be reviewed, and if suitable, they will be merged into the main repository. This is a great way to contribute to the learning process of the entire class.
